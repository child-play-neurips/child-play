        "Battleship is a two-player guessing game where each player has a fleet of ships on a secret grid and then takes turns guessing the locations of the opponent's ships. The objective is to sink all of the opponent's ships by correctly guessing their locations. O's in a board mean that the player selected a square to attack and there was no ship there - it's a miss. Had there been a ship there, instead of a O you would see an X. In your board, an <S> signifies a ship position, and a <~> signifies sea. Your input is just two numbers with a space in between, one for the row (from 0 to 4) and one for the column (from 0 to 4), like: 0 0, nothing else. Do not output anything else but the row col values.",

        "Battleship is a two-player guessing game where each player has a fleet of ships on a secret grid and then takes turns guessing the locations of the opponent's ships. The objective is to sink all of the opponent's ships by correctly guessing their locations. O's in a board mean that the player selected a square to attack and there was no ship there - it's a miss. Had there been a ship there, instead of a O you would see an X. In your board, an <S> signifies a ship position, and a <~> signifies sea. Your input is just two numbers with a space in between, one for the row (from 0 to 4) and one for the column (from 0 to 4), like: 0 0, nothing else.

        "Battleship is a two-player guessing game where each player has a fleet of ships on a secret grid and then takes turns guessing the locations of the opponent's ships. The objective is to sink all of the opponent's ships by correctly guessing their locations. O's in a board mean that the player selected a square to attack and there was no ship there - it's a miss. Had there been a ship there, instead of a O you would see an X. In your board, an <S> signifies a ship position, and a <~> signifies sea. Your input is just two numbers with a space in between, one for the row (from 0 to 4) and one for the column (from 0 to 4), like: 0 0, nothing else. Do not output anything else but the row col values.",

The objective is to sink all of the opponent's ships by correctly guessing their locations. O's in a board mean that the player selected a square to attack and there was no ship there - it's a miss. Had there been a ship there, instead of a O you would see an X. In your board, an <S> signifies a ship position, and a <~> signifies sea. Your input is just two numbers with a space in between, one for the row (from 0 to 4) and one for the column (from 0 to 4), like: 0 0, nothing else. Do not output anything else but the row col values.",
