The first player to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. You will play as player 1, therefore you play with X while your adversary plays with the symbol O. Your input is then a number (from 0 to 2) for the row followed by a space and another number (from 0 to 2) for the column, nothing else.",
